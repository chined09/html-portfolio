<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello World, My name is Edwin Chin.  I live in Puerto Rico, a beautiful island in the caribbean,
  I work for a solar panel company and we sell Tesla batteries for your home.  This company is called Windmar Home and it is very succesful 
  because in Puerto Rico we have lots of power outages.  I love working at Windmar because my personal goal in life is to rid the world of
     CO2     emmisions and fight pollution and contamination in all its forms.  
</p>

<p>One of my hobbys is watching horse races. And I've built several handicapping systems with little success. My other hobby is tournament
  poker but I have to travel to Dallas or Las Vegas in order to play because there is little action here in Puerto Rico.
</p>

<p>The other thing I enjoy is learning. I read books and watch educational videos all the time.  I'm trying to learn Mandarin since its my 
  fathers native language.  And lately I'm learning how to code.
